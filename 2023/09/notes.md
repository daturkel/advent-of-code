Kind of messed up that they give easy problems on weekends and hard problems on weekdays...

This one pretty much spells out how to solve it in the problem statement, with the diagram kind of telling you exactly what steps to follow. All I do is build up a "buffer" of differences, then I work backwards through the buffer using each to extrapolate the next value for the next. Part two is the same, just with minor modifications to move backwards.
