graph navigation. in part 1, we have to find fully connected subsets of a graph. it's not too hard because we only care about subsets of size 3 containing a node starting with t.

for part 2, we need to find the biggest subsets. I just brute forced with some shortcuts to avoid checking smaller subsets.
