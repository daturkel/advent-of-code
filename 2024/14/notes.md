probably my least favorite AOC ever. in part one it's trivial to move the drones 100 steps into the future and calculate the desired metric.

in part 2, we have to find the "christmas tree." some incorrect assumptions you might make:
- it's centered
- all drones are involved in the christmas tree
- the number of drones on a spot in the grid matters

In the end, the easiest solution was just to find a grid with a long string of drones in a row. This is the tree. You can also minimize the metric from part 1, which works though there's no reason it needs to work.
