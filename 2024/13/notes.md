This problem is about finding the right number of button presses to get a crane over a prize. Button A moves you ax,ay and button B moves you bx,byâ€”however, button A costs 3 to press while button B costs only 1. What's the cheapest way to get to px py?

It's a huge misdirect to suggest that the solver needs to find the cheapest way: this is a system of 2 equations with two unknowns, so there's only one or 0 solutions. Use your preferred method of solving a system and then just return 3*a + b.

For part two, we make the px and py coordinates much bigger, but this doesn't matter because our solution is constant time.
