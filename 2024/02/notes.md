A tricky day: determine if a list of numbers follows some rules: every list must be ascending or descending, with all differences between 1 and 3.

In part 2, we're allowed to remove one index to make it work.

I tried to be clever, only removing the indices necessary for each rule violation. Turns out brute forcing wouldn't have taken very long at all.
