Nothing particularly challenging on day 1: sort two lists and count the elementwise absolute distance between the sorted values, then also count how many times each item in list 1 appears in list 2 (which we do with two defaultdicts since we actually care about repeat keys in the first list), so instead of looping through the entire first list, we end up only looping through unique items in the first list and properly multiplying by how many times they occurred.
